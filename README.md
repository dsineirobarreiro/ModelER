# ModelER

## How to run it

In order to make use of all the project's functionalities, it is necessary to run a Jupyter Notebook in GoogleColab. The file _api.ipynb_ contains an example with everything ready, but you must configure both Hugging Face and Ngrok to work with your account.
Once the GoogleColab's Notebook is configured and running, the following command will open a local server on your laptop:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

You can access this server from your browser at _http://localhost:8000_
